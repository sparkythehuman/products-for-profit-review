## What is Products for Profit?
With Products for Profit (aka PFP) you can learn everything you need to know to make money reselling products from stores like Target and Walmart on platforms like Facebook Marketplace, eBay, and even Amazon. You will learn how to determine if a product is profitable, how to source it, where to sell it, and even how to ship it. 

There are 3 basic things that make up the program.

1. Private Telegram Group Chat -- a group chat with 1500+ resellers from newbies to veterans. As you might imagine with a 1500 person group chat, it's constantly going and can sometimes veer off topic, but there is a ton of knowledge dropped there. If you have any specific questions, you can ask the group and you'll usually get a good response. 
2. Weekly Webinars -- every week there is a 2 hour webinar with announcements, hot products, and a specific training focus. For example, "How to get started on Amazon?". You can attend live or watch later. 
3. Profitable Items List -- there is a la group chat where profitable items or important announcements are pushed out. There might be a few posts a day, but they usually BOLOs or products to Be On the LookOut for. 

Whether you're brand new to reselling or have been doing it for years, there is value in having access to a community sharing their knowledge, thoughts, and resources. 

The community has been the best part of PFP for me. Having a group of like minded people to answer specific questions, share what they are seeing, and motivate and support me on my reselling journey has been awesome. 

## Is It A Scam?
No. First off, when you join you get exactly what's advertised. You get access to the group, the profitable items lists, and access to past and future webinars. Second, the administrators of the group are experts in reselling. They are making thousands of dollars a month reselling products and share their knowledge with the group. I've even had messaged with administrators 1:1 to answer questions. In one instance, I had a specific question about an eBay sale and the admin walked me through exactly what I needed to do. 

## Is It an MLM? A "pyramid scheme"?
Again, no. It's not an MLM because there is not any sort of multiple level compensation plan. And it's not a pyramid scheme, where you're paid primarily through new sign-ups/recruits. There is an affiliate program, but even then, the primary focus of the program is by making money reselling and not recruiting. 

In fact, there is some debate in the group whether adding more people adds value by helping to control the market or makes it harder by adding competition. 

## What Are The Pros And Cons?

Pros: 

- Community support 
- Hot products takes guess work out of reselling
- Up to date training
- Learn by doing
- No experience necessary

Cons: 

- Not a traditional course
- Group chat can be overwhelming
- Hot products are usually retail arbitrage 
- Hot products can be hard to find

## Who Is Joe Hart?

## Is It Good For Beginners?

## Is It For Me?
Deciding on which reselling program to join is a pretty big decision. Choosing the wrong one can lead to wasted time, money, and motivation. On the flip side, joining a good program can cut down on the learning curve of building your reselling business as well as tell you the products you should focus on. 

Even though you can start making money on day 1, becoming a good reseller requires a fair amount of time and commitment. 

- **Looking to get rich quick**
- **Don’t have some disposable income to invest** (see below for much money you need to get started)
- **Don’t have time / work too many jobs**
- **Don't have access to reliable transportation**
- **Get discouraged easily**
- **Hate to problem solve**

You have to take a real look in the mirror here, because the simple truth is that reselling is not for everyone. It's work! But if your looking to supplement or even replace your 9-5 and you put in the work, you can make money -- sometimes even more money than you make at your 9-5!

## How Soon Will I Make Money?
I signed up on Saturday, bought products at Walmart on Sunday, and made local sales that netted me over a $100 profit on Monday. I did have a little bit of beginners luck because I caught a hot product restock. But I also found a product on my own (not on the hot products list) using the techniques and principles I learned from the group. I was selling that product locally for profit the next week. 

If you're willing to put in the work and learn, you can make money pretty much right away. There are stories from people in the group making thousands in their first month, but obviously results may vary.

## How Much Money Can I Make?

## How Much Does It Cost?
The membership to the program is $75/month.

## Is It Worth It?

## What's Included?

## How Much Money Do I Need To Get Started?
You do need some sort of bankroll to get started. First off, you'll need the $75 for the first month. Then you'll need money to buy your products.

However, one great thing about this is that if a product doesn't move, you can save your reciepts and take it back. I've bought items that I thought looked like good deals but ended up moving slowly than I liked or at lower price points that I wanted, so I took them back. Make sure to take note of the stores return policy. For example, Walmart gives you 90 days to return most items, but electronics can only be returned within 30 days. 

I also put all my resale purchases on a credit card, use my payments to pay the credit card balance in full, and keep the profits in the bank. I only recommend this if you **pay your balance in full**. If you pay interest on your resale purchases, that cuts into your profits.

So besides the $75 you pay for the membership, you **should** get all your money back plus profits, so you don't need a huge bankroll to get started. Many veterans recommend starting with lower priced items that flip quickly and then over time buy and hold products that take longer to go up in price (sometimes years) but have much higher returns, like lego sets.

I personally haven't held anything for more 90 days, if it doesn't sell, I take it back within the return period. But as time goes on and I build up my bankroll, I may start buying and holding more products for greater returns (which comes with a greater risk since you can't return).

## Final Verdict
